ROB:
Great job, detective. You have helped OSCAR find the culprit through valuable observation and transparency. "Only 4.46 percent of crimes recorded in Mexico result in convictions" (Business Insider, 2016). Congratulations on leaning towards that percentage in this made-up scenario that serves as a metaphor for some of the conditions many Mexicans endure.
ELENA:
Here, Oscar. Your father was saving up to ensure a better future for you.
Esmeralda confessed she took him in order to keep the fortune to herself for free. This ring represents the efforts your father made for you. Take it.

ROB:
Hmm... where could OSCAR be?
ELENA:
I don't know...
ELENA:
Hey, look over here.
FRANK, THE DOG: 
MR. MASON, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE 3 DAYS LEFT TO PAY BACK THE MONEY YOU OWE ME. I'LL BE WORKING THE USUAL SHIFT AT THE PAWN SHOP. STOP BY AS FAST AS YOU CAN. SIGNED, FRANK THE DOG.
ELENA:
According to the date that's written in it, this note's from 4 days ago. I think we nailed something.
ROB:
Totally. Ugh... for some reason, it suddenly smelled like a pet store. I hate those places.
ELENA:
Rob, check the database for Pawn Shops. There must be one owned by this "FRANK, the dog".

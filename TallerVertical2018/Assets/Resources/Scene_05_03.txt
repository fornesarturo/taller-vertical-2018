ELENA:
Could you now tell us more about your relationship with Mason, please?
FRANK:
Look, if you really want to know something, talk to his boss; Salamandra. He's probably in the sewers at the end of the street. I sure hope you find Mr. Mason since, you know... I have some pending business with him. Good bye.

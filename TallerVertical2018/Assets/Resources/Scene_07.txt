ROB:
Elena, let me talk this time.
Hello, Mrs.
ESMERALDA: 
Um, who is this?
ROB: 
We're detectives. Rob and Elena and we're looking for information about the disappearance of Mr. Mason. Can we ask you some questions?
Rob:
How did I do?
ELENA:
Don't ruin it, Rob.
ESMERALDA:
I haven't heard about that guy.
ROB:
Alright, thanks for your help.
ELENA:
Rob, are you out of your mind? Mrs., an old mouse who used to sell valuable artifacts in the sewers disappeared last night and we're worried about his son. We know you deal with metal trafficking, so we think that it's very likely that you two have closed business at some point.
ESMERALDA: 
I already told you I don't know that guy. And I don't know anything about that beautiful ring, either. 
ROB:
Come on Elena, stop harassing this woman.
ELENA: 
I haven't done anything against her rights. I haven't spoken about any ring, either. Tell me, what do you know about it? Where were you last night?
ESMERALDA:
First of all, calm down. I'll admit Mason and I have done business several times before; but even so, I have no clue about his whereabouts. As you can see, I'm trapped inside this cage and I can't go anywhere...Please don't tell the police about my deals with cheese noir. I'll pay you.

ROB:
Well, sure. But that means our laws are respected.
ELENA:
Nah, laws are just make us living zombies. Wait, there's someone coming.
ROB: 
Laws determine a way to live in society and...
ELENA:
Mean nothing if you don't understand them. 
OSCAR:
Detective Elena, please help me!
ROB:
How did you get in here, boy?
ELENA:
Rob! Be kind with the kid, he said he needs our help. Now, tell me boy, what is this emergency?
OSCAR:
It's my father, last night he didn't come back home from work... It's been a while; I'm worried he has gone missing!
ELENA
Hm... this sounds serious, we have to find that man before something else happens. Young man, what is your name?
OSCAR:
Oscar, my name's Oscar.
ELENA:
Alright, Oscar, let's go look for some answers. Can you lead me to your house, please?	ROB, you check from above and inform me on everything.
ROB:
Alright, chief. I'll get to work.

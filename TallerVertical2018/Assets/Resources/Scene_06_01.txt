ELENA:
Don't you have anything to say about that scratch you have?
SALAMANDRA:
Umm... Part of the job. It's a tough one, you know? Disputes between employees and such. Anyway, maybe Esmeralda could tell you what you want to hear, instead. Hehe. You know, fun fact: she buys any kind of metal. If you have any luck, she may still be awake right now.
ROB: But where can we find her?
SALAMANDRA: 
Ever heard of human residences?

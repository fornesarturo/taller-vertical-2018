SALAMANDRA:
Who are you? 
ROB: I'm detective Rob and she is my assistant Elena.
ELENA: Haha, very funny Rob... We're looking for some information about Mr. Mason, who has gone missing. Do you happen to know anything about that?
SALAMANDRA: 
Mason?... hmm... I haven't heard that name in a while, tee-hee. The last thing I knew about him was that he sold things independently after his shifts here, supposedly in secret. He used to spend hours working everyday. Not that I made him do it, of course.If you ask me to be honest, that guy really got on my nerves. Always looking out for "the greater good" and all; but what exactly is the greater good? I bet it's finding a ton of cheese noir, am I right?
ROB: 
Um, ok...

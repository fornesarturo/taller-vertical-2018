ELENA: 
Oscar, please tell me more about your father's routine; just to help me get into context.
OSCAR:
Well, my father is a trash collector. He works in the sewers. He usually arrives early to his job and checks in with his boss. He's got a clean record. At the end of his tiring work shift, he goes to the dump to sell all the valuable things he collected.
ELENA:
Mhm. And, I'm guessing you both have a good relationship?
OSCAR:
Hmm... a pretty good one, actually. In order to make a bit more money, we both work very hard. I'm young, but I know I must work in order to earn a place in the world.
OSCAR: 
Anyway, forget it... sometimes he doesn't return home and I get pretty upset; but this time, he's really gone.
ELENA:
That's interesting, Oscar. I think I'd better go to the sewers with Rob to look for some clues.
